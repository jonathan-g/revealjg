\title{Verify that files in a target directory match files in a reference directory}
\usage{
verifyDependencyFiles(
  dependency,
  outputDir,
  mustWork = TRUE,
  copyMissing = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{dependency}{A single HTML dependency object.}

\item{outputDir}{The directory in which a subdirectory should be created for
this dependency.}

\item{mustWork}{If \verb{TRUE`` and }dependency\verb{ does not point to a directory on disk (but rather a URL location), an error is raised. If `FALSE} then non-disk dependencies are returned without modification.}

\item{copyMissing}{Copy files from the source directory when the target file
is either missing or does not match the file in the reference directory.}
}
\value{
The dependency with its \code{src} value updated to the new
location's absolute path.
}
\description{
Compare files from a reference (source) directory to those in a target
directory. Issue warnings or errors for mismatches or missing files.
Optionally fix missing or mismatched files by copying from the reference
directory.
}
\details{
In order for disk-based dependencies to work with static HTML files, it's
generally necessary to copy them to either the directory of the referencing
HTML file, or to a subdirectory of that directory. This function makes it
easier to perform that copy.
}
\seealso{
\code{\link{makeDependencyRelative}} can be used with the returned
value to make the path relative to a specific directory.
